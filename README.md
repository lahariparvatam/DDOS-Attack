# DDoS Attack Detection Using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning models to classify network traffic as either normal or DDoS attacks. The final model is deployed using Streamlit for interactive predictions.

## 🔍 Features
- Real-time CSV file upload
- Model prediction using trained classifier
- Simple and clean Streamlit UI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas
- Joblib

## 🧪 How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Upload a CSV file to get predictions

## 📦 Model File
Make sure `ddos_model.pkl` is present in the same folder as `app.py`.
